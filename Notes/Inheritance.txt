Inheritance notes
========================
=> Never ever create sub class object directly (abstraction can not be implemented)
=> A super class reference can store all its sub class obejcts.
=> reference of a super can be used access all methods in the super class,
   and common methods of sub class (overrriden methods)
=> reference of super class can not be used to access the individual methods of 
   sub classes. (a method which is defined in the sub class, and not defined in the 
                  super class)
