abstract class
--------------------
-> an abstract is a method specification which contains zero or more abstract methods
   and concrete methods

what is abstract method?
-------------------------
-> abstract method is a method specification which contains no body.
-> abstract method mustbe defined only in the abstract classes and interface
-> we can not create object to abstract class, because it contains un implemented methods
-> but we can craete reference to an abstract class.
-> the reference of an abstract class can be used to access everything in the abstract class.
   and also overrriden methods of sub classses.
-> the reference of an abstract class can not be used to access the individual methods of a sub class
-> All the sub classes of an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods
   of a abstract class
-> If any sub class not implemented any one of abstract methods of abstract class, 
   then that sub class must be defined as 'abstract'
-> final methods can not be overridden in the sub class. so abstract methods can not defined as 'final'
