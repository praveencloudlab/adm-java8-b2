Hands on 
----------------------
1. create a Employee class and add 5 Employee Objects
ex:
Employee e1=new Employee(1,"Praveen",15000);
Employee e1=new Employee(2,"Praveen",15000);
Employee e1=new Employee(3,"Praveen",15000);
Employee e1=new Employee(1,"Praveen",15000);
Employee e1=new Employee(1,"Praveen",15000);

-> Now display number of (count) duplicate obejcts of Employee class
-> If duplicates found, then do not display them. Display only unique employee objects
